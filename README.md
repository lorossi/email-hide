# Email Hide
*Because stopping spam is not impossible!*

  Whoever needs to publish their email on their personal website knows what's going to happen. SPAM.

  A lot of it.

  Webcrawlers constantly roam the web, hoping to find some new mails to reap in order to be sold to spammers.
  It looks like nobody is ever safe.

  Luckily, though, that's not true.

  In order to save loading time and processing speed, webcrawlers don't load javscript.
  To exploit this flaw in our advance, we can hide the emails in a separate script made specifically to inject some text in the DOM once the page is loaded.

  So this program generates a .js script hiding all the sensible information with repeated Base64 encoding and will keep you safe from spambots.
